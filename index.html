                            Jiu-Jitsu is a martial arts style that focuses on grappling and ground fighting. It is one of the oldest martial arts styles, and it has been proven to be very effective in real-world situations. Because Jiu-Jitsu emphasizes ground fighting, it is an excellent self-defense style for people who are smaller or weaker than their opponents.

                    What is Jiu-Jitsu and what are its origins?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jiu-jitsu is a martial art that employs grappling and submission techniques. It is said to have originated in India more than two thousand years ago and was brought to Japan by Buddhist monks in the sixth century AD. Jiu-jitsu evolved into a highly effective form of self-defense and was soon adopted by the samurai warrior class of Japan. Lufkin Martial Arts is a great place to learn self-defense. In addition to the traditional martial arts disciplines like Karate and Taekwondo, Lufkin Martial Arts also teach Jiu-Jitsu, a modern form of self-defense that focuses on leverage and technique rather than strength and power.
